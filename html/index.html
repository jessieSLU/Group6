					<p>BAGUIO CITY, July 7(PIA) -- The city council finally passed the Baguio City Environment Code for the protection of all surroundings, focused on conservation, protection, management and administration of this mountain resort.
The Environment Code has been pending before the city council since 2003 and has undergone several revisions through several administrations, including by the current council, in order to reflect current realities and standards.
The code will benefit present and future inhabitants of the city, ensuring that it remains as an eco-cultural tourist destination as stated in its declaration of policy.
The code includes more attention on high-risk areas mainly the protection and management of lands within the city focusing on protected areas covering national parks, natural monuments, natural parks, protected landscapes, resource reserves, strict nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries.
Atty. Erdolfo Balajadia, chairman of the Baguio Regreening Movement, is pleased that the city council approved the Environment Code.
The passage of the environment code, Balajadia said is a milestone achievement for good environmental practices that could enhance the city as a whole, it is a next key step in implementing a sound and sustainable environmental regulation. It is for the future generations to enjoy the natural resources, and clean air, he added.
Mayor Mauricio Domogan is delighted with another landmark achievement of the city council. He said it’s about time to have an environment code for our city’s sake. (JDP/JBZ- PIA CAR)
