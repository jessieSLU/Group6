					<p>Contamination is the presentation of contaminants into the common habitat that cause antagonistic change. Contamination can appear as compound substances or energy, for example, noise, warmth or light. Contaminations can be either outside substances or energies, or naturally occurring contaminants. Contamination is frequently classed as point source or nonpoint source contamination. These are the forms of contamination that we are facing:</p>
					<h3>Air contamination</h3>
					<p>Air contamination is the arrival of poisons into the air that are negative to human wellbeing and the planet in general.</p>
					<h3>Water pollution</h3>
					<p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies very often by human activities.</p>
					<h3>Noise pollution</h3>
					<p>Noise pollution is a frame and level of ecological sound that is for the most part viewed as liable to annoy, divert or even cause harm other individuals.</p>
